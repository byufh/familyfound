Here are some visualization things I want to do:

- http://www.jasondavies.com/coffee-wheel/ An interactive (zoomable) fan chart
- http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/tree.html a node tree (mindmap like)
- a wheel with internal connections.... how would I use this?

- zoomable tree maps....is there a good use for this? last names, perhaps?

- here's a nice horizontal tree http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nest/
- another horiz tree http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/tree.html
- word cloud

Roadmap
-------

0.1 - find how you are related to a certain person.
    - the use case is -> you know you're related to a person, but you can't find
      how.

0.2 - find the closest available temple ordinances to you, listed by person
      along with relevent information such as possible duplicates, etc.

Alternate Name: FamilySorcery ? :) maybe not
